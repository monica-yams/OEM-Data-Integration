# OEM-Data-Integration

## Project Overview: Optimizing OEM Data Integration

In this project, we embarked on a comprehensive initiative to streamline the integration and utilization of OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) data through efficient data handling processes. The primary objectives were to extract data via API calls using Azure Data Factory, transform it into structured formats suitable for analytical purposes, and create insightful reports using Power BI.

## Data Extraction and Loading:
The project began with establishing robust API connections within Azure Data Factory to pull raw OEM data directly into designated SQL tables. This initial phase ensured that data acquisition was automated, timely, and reliable, laying a solid foundation for subsequent processing.

## Data Transformation and Schema Refinement:
Upon ingestion, the raw data was processed through a series of transformations aimed at refining it into dimension and fact tables. These refined schemas not only improved data quality but also enhanced the efficiency of analytical queries and reporting downstream.

## Creation of Consumed Views for Reporting:
To facilitate intuitive and actionable insights, consumed views were created based on refined data schemas. These views served as the foundation for generating interactive and visually compelling reports using Power BI. By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, stakeholders gained access to dynamic dashboards and detailed visualizations that provided deep insights into OEM performance metrics and trends.

## Outcome and Benefits:
Through this project, we achieved significant improvements in data accessibility, accuracy, and reporting agility. Stakeholders benefited from timely and relevant insights derived from consolidated OEM data, empowering informed decision-making and strategic planning. The integration of API-driven data extraction, structured transformation, and Power BI reporting not only enhanced operational efficiency but also positioned the organization for future scalability and innovation in data analytics.
